				<h4>On Time</h4>
				<p>Patterson Pump is a <strong><em>real</em></strong> fire pump manufacturer. Unlike many of our competitors who are assembly plants, Patterson does all machining of cases/impellers/shafts, fabrications of fuel tanks, etc in-house. This not only allows us to maintain the quality we want for our products, but it also enables us to detect and correct any defects during the machining process which enables Patterson to deliver orders on time, all the time. We also have REDDOT delivery program which can deliver fire pumps as quickly as 10 days, subject to availabilities of drivers and controllers.
